# Murdered-In-Plain-Text

This is a repository for the Twine game Murdered In Plain Text. The ASCII was Clear, but the Motive wasn't. 

The game can be accessed [here](https://Susanne404.github.io/Murdered-In-Plain-Text/)

The game is developed by the founders of the Bits and Bots study group. 
Following the succesfull game [File Format Fling](https://francesca4242.github.io/File_Format_Fling/), that was released on World Digital Preservation Day 2024, we are back for a new and even more exiting game. A murder mystery where Cluedo meets Midsommer Murders, in an Agatha Christie and old silent movie setting. 

Goal of the game: Find the clues and discover which file format has gone rogue, reveal the murder weapon and the motive.
